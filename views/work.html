        <h1>His Amazing Legacy</h1>
        <p>Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[223] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[398] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring.[44] In songs such as "Man in the Mirror", "Black or White", Heal the World, "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice.[399][400] He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.[401][402] He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,[403] and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.</p>
